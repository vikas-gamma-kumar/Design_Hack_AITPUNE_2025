            <h1>Principal's Message
            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>AIT was established in 1994 and within a short span of 30 years since inception as compared to some old
                institutes like COEP, it has established itself as a prestigious engineering institution under
                Savitribai Phule Pune University (formerly University of Pune). Our students have consistently shown
                very good performance and have obtained excellent placements. All departments of AIT obtained
                reaccreditation from the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for three years. This has been possible
                due to the excellent co-ordination and support of the staff, management, administration, students and
                their parents. AIT is also getting top ranking in NIRF, Outlook, Data Quest, THE WEEK and similar
                agencies.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The excellent facilities of our college are in a continuous process of up gradation. Our students are
                curious and avail the latest equipment, software etc. much beyond requirements of the syllabus. They are
                also provided with avenues and the state of the art facilities to develop an overall personality. Many
                students have fetched laurels in Sports, Paper Presentations, Hackathons, Essay, Debate Competitions at
                National/International Levels; as well developed social useful software. Recently we started developing
                culture of startup in AIT it will result in the small step towards Atmanirbahar Bharat
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>I am sure our students will continue their stellar performance during the course and their career ahead.
                I am also certain that they will put in their best efforts towards post graduate and research studies
                and carve an envious career. I am also confident about their potential in accepting global challenges
                and reinforcing the AIT brand name, shortly in the World map.</p>
